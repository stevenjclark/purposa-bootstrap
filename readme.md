# Purposa Bootstrap Theme

## What this project does

This repository includes a project structure with a build script that builds a custom Purposa CSS version of Bootstrap 4, using Gulp. It also includes our color scheme, custom fonts from fonts.com and the FontAwesome icon library. 

There's also an HTML file that contains a neatly organized collection of Bootstrap components, so you can instantly see the outcome.

## Prerequisites

- This works on Windows, macOS and Linux.
- Node Package Manager and Gulp are required. Make sure you can run `gulp -v` and `npm -v`.
- You can get Node at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), then install gulp using `npm install gulp-cli -g`

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `gulp watch`
4. Look at `index.html`
5. Add any Bootstrap Sass variables into `scss/_custom-variables.scss`
6. Add any custom styles into `scss/_custom-styles.scss`. You can use Bootstrap's mixins here.
7. Repeat steps 4 to 6 until you like what you see :-)
